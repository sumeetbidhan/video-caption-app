# Video Captioning App

This is a simple React-based web app that allows users to load a video, add captions with time stamps, and display those captions on the video. The app also provides features to export and import caption data as JSON files. Additionally, users can edit or delete individual captions.

- **Caption Management**: Add, edit, and delete captions with time stamps.
- **Export Data**: Export captions and video data as a JSON file.
- **Import Data**: Import captions and video data from a JSON file.
- **Responsive UI**: The video player adjusts its size to the video content, ensuring it doesnâ€™t go out of the frame.
